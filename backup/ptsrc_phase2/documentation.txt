** DIFF OF SCAN.SSL FILE IS FOUND IN diff.txt **
List Of Changes:

	Changes to parser.pt:
	- broke the parser by modifying the file to execute a while loop and accept any
		input until the end of file is reached
	- added the new garnet character classes and semantic tokens to the input tokens and
		to the output tokens (lines 49 and 94, respectively)
	- added the new garnet character classes and semantic tokens to the character
		class map (line 823)

	Changes to scan.ssl:
	- modified the input declarations
	- modified the output declarations
	- modified the Scan rule to read the old PT syntax tokens as pIdentifiers,
		and to accept the new Garnet syntax tokens, and emit their respective identifiers
		(e.g. 'not' is emitted as pIdentifier, $ is emitted as pDollar, etc.)
	- modified the the Comment rule to only read characters after a '%' as a comment
	- removed the AlterateComment rule

	Changes to stdIdentifiers:
	- removed the old PT keywords
	- added the new Garnet keywords

Justification & Explaination of Changes:

	The stdIdentifiers file must be modified to read the new keywords. Additionally, the
	new keywords must be added to the scan.ssl file in the same order they are added
	to the stfIdentifiers file.

	The new character classes must be added to both scan.ssl & parser.pt, to be read as
	syntax tokens.
	They must be added to parser.pt so the compiler knows what new tokens have specific names
	(e.g $ is now lDollar & pDollar, ? is now lQuestion & pQuestion, etc.)
	These new syntax tokens also have to be added to scan.ssl so the Scan rule (the scanner)
	properly handles each new syntax token. When a new Garnet syntax token is read, the scanner
	should emit the respective output token (e.g. pPercent). When an old PT syntax token is read,
	the scanner should emit the pIdentifier token.
	Additionally, the scanner must handle the Comment input properly for a Garnet comment. This
	is done by modifiying the Comment rule.
